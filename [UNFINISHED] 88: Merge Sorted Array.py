# This optimal solution is similar to how the merge feature of merge sort works. For those unfamiliar to merge sort, it's a divide-and-conquer sorting
# algorithm that involves repeatedly diving the array into halfs until you have enough subarrays, then you merge those sorted subarrays together to create
# a new sorted subarray, and this merging process continues until the original array is reconstructed in sorted order. The division step takes O(log(n))
# and the merge step takes O(n) times. As a result, the solution to this problem will take O(n) time (in this case, it would be O(n+m) time for each array).
